		<p class="deck">ok so as u can see each we have so many planets. the one u already know is the sun which u have it in sagittarius.the planets represents energies and cosmic forces that manifest in different ways.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>cheat list</h3>
		<p><b>sun</b> represents whats exciting and vibrant about us ((ur personality or individuality))</p>
		<p><b>moon</b> shows our deepest feelings and instinctual responses ((ur emotions))</p>
		<p><b>mercury</b> relates to how we think & express ourselves ((how u communicate))</p>
		<p><b>venus</b> is the planets of priorities, beauty, love, and money ((is like ur preferences and usually describe how u love other things like ur love life))</p>
		<p><b>mars</b>represents ur deep primal energy ((ur motivation and drive))</p>
		<p><b>jupiter</b> is associated with fortune and good luck ((is like ur principles of growth/expansion ?? if that makes sense))</p>
		<p><b>saturn</b> is associated with restrictions, obligation, authority, career, and such ((is like responsibility))</p>
		<p><b>uranus</b> is related to individuality, rebellion, and the future ((how u seek freedom!!))</p>
		<p><b>neptune</b> represents spirituality, creativity, and intuitiv ((basically the aura that surrounds u))
		<p><b>pluto</b>shows the area of life where you'll personally face the intense powers of creation and destruction ((like ur transformation))</p>
		<br>
		<br><br>

		<p class="deck">every planet orbits the sun at a different speed, going slower and slower the farther they are from the sun. so all these planets r divided into two groups; the <b>"inner planets"</b> and the <b>"outer planets"</b></p>
		<p><b>inner planets</b> r the <b>sun</b>, <b>moon</b>, <b>mercury</b>, <b>mars</b>, and <b>venus</b>. they move quickly and as a result, they affect your day-to-day life, moods and habits.</p>
		<p>meanwhile, the <b>outter planets</b> r <b>jupiter</b>, <b>saturn</b>, <b>neptune</b>, <b>uranus</b>, and <b>pluto</b>. they move slowly and as a result they shape the bigger trends in your life.</p>
		<p>for example, we share the same uranus, neptune and pluto. which is why, these three planets r said to shape the entire generations</p>
