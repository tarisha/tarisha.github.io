		<p> <i><b>"what's a natal chart???"</b></i> A natal chart is a snapshot of the sky at the moment you were born.
		In essence, at the moment of your first breath is when you come into accord with the energies of the universe. That remains fixed throughout your lifetime. Your natal chart gives clues to your major life lessons, shows your destiny, reveals your personality traits and hidden desires, as well as points the way to your soul’s purpose.</p>
