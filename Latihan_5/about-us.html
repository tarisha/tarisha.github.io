                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>
                    On 20 December 2013, at its 68th session, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) proclaimed 3
                    March –
                    the day of signature of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
                    and Flora
                    (CITES) in 1973 – as UN World Wildlife Day to celebrate and raise awareness of the world’s wild
                    animals
                    and plants.
                    <br><br>
                    The UNGA resolution also designated the CITES Secretariat as the facilitator for the global
                    observance of
                    this special day for wildlife on the UN calendar. World Wildlife Day has now become the most
                    important
                    global annual event dedicated to wildlife.
                    <br><br>
                    World Wildlife Day will be celebrated in 2020 under the theme "Sustaining all life on Earth",
                    encompassing
                    all wild animal and plant species as key components of the world's biodiversity. This aligns with UN
                    Sustainable Development Goals 1, 12, 14 and 15, and their wide-ranging commitments on alleviating
                    poverty,
                    ensuring sustainable use of resources, and on conserving life both on land and below water to halt
                    biodiversity loss.
                    <br><br>
                    Earth is home to countless species of fauna and flora – too many to even attempt counting. This rich
                    diversity, and the billions of years during which its myriad elements have interacted, are precisely
                    what
                    has made our planet inhabitable for all living creatures, including humans. Historically, we have
                    depended
                    on the constant interplay and interlinkages between all elements of the biosphere for all our needs:
                    the
                    air we breathe, the food we eat, the energy we use, and the materials we need for all purposes.
                    However,
                    unsustainable human activities and overexploitation of the species and natural resources that make
                    up the
                    habitats and ecosystems of all wildlife are imperiling the world’s biodiversity. Nearly a quarter of
                    all
                    species are presently at risk of going extinct in the coming decades, and their demise would only
                    speed up
                    the disappearance of countless others, putting us in danger as well.
                    <br><br>
                    On World Wildlife Day 2020, we will celebrate the special place of wild plants and animals in their
                    many
                    varied and beautiful forms as a component of the world’s biological diversity. We will work to raise
                    awareness of the multitude of benefits of wildlife to people, particularly to those communities who
                    live in closest proximity to it, and we will discuss the threats they are facing and the urgent need
                    for
                    governments, civil society, private sector actors and individuals to add their voices and take
                    actions to
                    help conserve wildlife and ensure its continued use is sustainable.
