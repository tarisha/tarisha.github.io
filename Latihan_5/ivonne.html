                <h1>Ivonne Higuero</h1>
                <p id="degree">Secretary-General CITES Secretariat</p>
                <p>
                    We are extremely fortunate to count on the presence of an endless diversity of wild animals, plants,
                    and other lifeforms that together make up life on our planet. Humans around the world benefit every
                    single day from wildlife. In many ways, our history is the story of our species’ interaction with,
                    and
                    adaptation to, the diverse lifeforms present in our close vicinity. Since time immemorial, we have
                    used
                    wild plants and animals for out most basic needs: from the air we breathe, to the food we eat, to
                    the
                    materials we use for shelter and comfort.
                    <br><br>
                    The human well-being and prosperity that is derived from the direct exploitation of wildlife,
                    habitats
                    and ecosystems should not be to the detriment of the building blocks of a rich and diverse
                    biosphere.
                    The Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) was agreed in
                    1973 to avoid this by regulating international trade in wildlife and ensure that this trade is
                    legal,
                    sustainable and traceable.
                    <br><br>
                    More and more, however, the unsustainable exploitation of wild fauna and flora and their ecosystems
                    is
                    threatening their survival. Every single piece of the puzzle of life is essential and losing even
                    the
                    smallest of these pieces leaves us, and the entire planet, poorer. When human actions endanger
                    hundreds
                    of thousands of species, as they are doing today, it is the entire biosphere - of which we too are a
                    part - that is threatened.
                    <br><br>
                    We now face the immense challenge of living in harmony with nature so that we can fulfill our own
                    needs without neglecting those of the many lifeforms with which we share this planet on sea,
                    land and air.
                    <br><br>
                    The inclusion of endangered species in the CITES Appendices, the conservation efforts undertaken by
                    our Parties, and the added endeavors of partners in other Conventions or organizations working on
                    biodiversity and development helps to counteract the loss of biodiversity on the planet.
                    <br><br>
                    However, transformative changes are needed as we find ourselves at a critical turning point both for
                    our species and for the entire biosphere. Now more than ever we must come together in a joint effort
                    to sustain all life on Earth.
                    <br><br>
                    We are proud to do our part in advocating for a responsible and sustainable use of wildlife to
                    conserve
                    our world’s biodiversity. CITES is proud to host this year’s World Wildlife Day with the theme
                    "Sustaining all life on Earth", and we invite all of the planet’s citizens to join us in the
                    celebration
                    of one of the milestones of this “Biodiversity Super Year”.
