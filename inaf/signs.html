	<h3>MOVING ON TO ZODIAC SIGNS!</h3>
	<p>
	each planet is associated with a zodiac sign, and that sign will exhibit traits of the planet. on previous page, i've given u a cheat list on how each planet affects one individual. but how does it mean to have YOUR sun in capricorn??? or YOUR mercury in capricorn too??!? or YOUR venus in aquarius?!?!!?!?? and so on <br><br>

	so as mentioned before, planets represent <b>energies</b>. they r like the actors in play. WHILE the signs describe THE WAYS in which these planetary energies r used. get it? get ittt? get itttttt? i assume u get it :)
